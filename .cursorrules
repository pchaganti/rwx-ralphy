# Cursor Rules for Ralphy

## Code Change Philosophy

Keep changes small and focused:
- One logical change per commit
- If a task feels too large, break it into subtasks
- Prefer multiple small commits over one large commit
- Run feedback loops after each change, not at the end
- Quality over speed. Small steps compound into big progress.

## Task Prioritization

When choosing the next task, prioritize in this order:
1. Architectural decisions and core abstractions
2. Integration points between modules
3. Unknown unknowns and spike work
4. Standard features and implementation
5. Polish, cleanup, and quick wins

Fail fast on risky work. Save easy wins for later.

## Code Quality

Write concise code. At the end of each code file ask yourself:
"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"
If yes, simplify.

Avoid over-engineering:
- Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
- Don't add features beyond what was asked
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up
- A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability

Clean code practices:
- Don't fill files just for the sake of it
- Don't leave dead code - delete unused code completely
- No backwards-compatibility hacks for removed code
- No `// removed` comments
- Be organized, concise, and clean

## Legacy Mindset

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden.
Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the team down.

You are shaping the future of this project:
- The patterns you establish will be copied
- The corners you cut will be cut again

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.
